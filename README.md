# Firefox Container Sorter
Firefox containers is a fantastic plug-in with little drawbacks and is a must-have for anyone with multiple clients that share the same services. The lack of alphabetical ordering of containers, however, is a pain and can be a nightmare.

In the later versions of Containers, filtering has been added to make life easier, but in certain menus, you cannot use this, like in "reopen with container", for example. Here, it is great to have each container alphabetized anyway. 

So, I've made a powershell script. It's a simple script that takes the JSON file that FireFox creates, splits the array out, sorts it, then puts it back together again.

**This is still in alpha, please use at own risk**
